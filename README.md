# Stardew Valley API

**Very much a WIP**

I wanted to play with some new technologies and I've never built an API, so I decided to make something to provide various bits of data about different aspects of Stardew Valley. I'm writing this readme at the literal start of this project with basically nothing written, but for my own sake here's a rough checklist of what all I hope to eventually have here:

- REST endpoints
- Setup for GraphQL
- Data in some kind of database (leaning towards MongoDB)

As far as what data will be provided, I don't have a solid plan for that but I'd imagine it'll be data about villagers, crops, artisan goods, monsters, shops/houses/etc., and probably more. I'm guessing once I figure out the technical details behind the project, it won't be too bad to get as much data in as I can think of, and endpoints/queries to match.

_This project has no official affiliation with the game, ConcernedApe, or anyone else who has any official connection to Stardew Valley._
